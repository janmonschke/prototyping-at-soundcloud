					<h2 class="sc-text-shadow">Prototyping<span class="fragment current-visible">? ü§î </span></h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Prototyping is a term that gets thrown around a lot in many different situations.</p>
						<p>Therefore there might be some confusion about what we actually mean when we speak about prototyping.</p>
						<p>To make sure we're all on the same page I want to start by defining what prototyping is, at least, in terms of what it means in the context of this talk.</p>
						<p>So what do we (Jan and I) mean when we say prototyping?</p>
						<p>Prototyping is transforming the 'what-ifs' ideas in your head into something tangible. Something you can experience, work through, play with and test</p>
						<p>You can think of a prototype as a simulation model of how the idea will work, how the application will flow, how the interaction works, how screens transition from one to another etc.</p>
						<p>But why would we spend our time prototyping? How is it useful? Let‚Äôs take a look at a two examples where prototyping comes in handy.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/flow1.png">
					<h2 class="sc-text-shadow">Flows</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>This is a part of a typical flow diagram</p>
						<p>But who actually fully grasps what is going on here?</p>
						<p>Would you be able to evluate the usability and feasibilty of this solution by looking at this flow diagram?</p>
						<p>This is where prototyping becomes very useful</p>
						<p>Prototypes help us communicate concepts.</p>
						<p>Imagine the difference between me presenting this flow diagram to you or you actually being able to click through it yourself on a device? Which one are you more likely to understand and to be able to give feedback on?</p>
						<p>Additionally, and this actually happens to me quite a lot - something you think might natural when looking at static screen diagrams often feels very wrong when it's in tangible format.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 class="sc-text-shadow">Animations</h2>
					<img src="images/animations-pulse.png" />
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Let's take a look at another example</p>
						<p>Let's imagine you were given the task of making this introduction flow feel more alive and interesting</p>
						<p>You think of adding animations - and you plan it out!</p>
						<p>But how are you going to communicate them back?</p>
						<p>That's where a prototype like this one here becomes useful! Without a prototype - I do believe there could be a lot of misinterpretation when explaining your idea to others. So when you swipe right the circles here spin and then the....... yeah you can imagine where this would go wrong</p>
						<p>But how can we make a prototype like this one? What tools exist to do these things?</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Mention recently-played test where users where presented with static data.
							Expectation is key in those prototypes and when user's have an emotional connection
							to your product (e.g. they are collecting things on your platform) it is important to fulfill
							those emotional expectations.
						</p>
						<p>real data === not-polished data (long usernames, weird artowrk, color schemes) that you just don't design with</p>
						<p>
							Freedom as in users are free to do whatever and are not taken by their hands. You want them
							to express themselves freely.

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When we want feedback on the usability of something we're trying out, the concept and the design, we bring users in to the office to test out prototypes</p>
						<p>One way we get feedback on our prototypes is to bring users into the office to test them</p>
						<p>A series of regular in-house usability tests</p>
						<p>We do it every three weeks to get regular unbiased feedback</p>
						<p>Everyone involved in the feature participates, designers, engineers, product managers. Creates empathy with the users. We are actually very determined that everyone participates in the test - not just ux researchers. </p>
						<p>Imagine the difference between me telling you the results from a usability test or you actually being there in a session seeing a user struggle with something? Which one are you more likely to remember?</p>
						<p>Quick feedback: quickly test your designs</p>
						<p>When we need people using the prototype in their own setting and over an extended period of time we do something we call a diary study</p>
						<p>We give users a prototype to use with for around 2 weeks while checking in with us every other day</p>
						<p>We do this when we need more than quick feedback</p>
						<p>We also do a lot of informal internal testing</p>
						<p>We distribute the prototypes company wide and we get back a lot of feedback that way</p>
						<p>By doing this everyone can stay up to date with what product design is up to</p>
						<p>It's also been a great way for us to finetune WIP recommendation algorithms</p>
						<p>As you can maybe see by now - we've been doing prototyping for while however it has varied how we've done them, nowadays we mostly do everything in React Native - however that didn't use to be the case</p>
