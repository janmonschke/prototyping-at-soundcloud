					<h2>Prototyping? ü§î</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Before we dive into how we do prototyping at SoundCloud, what is prototyping and why do we do it?</p>
						<p>Show a long flow chart of how one should navigate through an app and then show video of a prototype</p>
						<p>Prototyping helps you get ideas out of your head and into something more tangible‚Äîsomething you can feel,experience, work through, play with, and test.</p>
						<p>Prototyping is a way to work through your own designs.</p>
						<p>Prototyping is generative. As a generative process, prototyping often leads to innovation and a significant savings in time, effort, and cost.</p>
						<p>Prototypes communicate through show and tell.</p>
						<p>Prototyping reduces misinterpretation.</p>
						<p>Prototyping creates a rapid feedback loop, which ultimately reduces risk.</p>
						<p>Prototyping allows us to communicate concepts and make data-driven design decisions.</p>

					<h2>Prototyping @ SoundCloud</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The tools jan mentioned above are great for testing simple interactions or animations but however fall short when dealing with data and distribution. A lot of link sharing and doesn't feel real because you don't have your own data - not genuine feedback</p>
						<p>Therefore we've built a version of the SoundCloud app solely made for prototyping purposes.</p>

					<h2>High Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<blockquote>
						A prototype that does not <strong>feel</strong> like a prototype.
					</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>A fully functioning app / site</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Real production data</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">‚ÄùSame‚Äù design like <i>the real thing</i>&trade;</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Users are presented with their real account data</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">‚ÄùSimpler‚Äù implementation (e.g. performance)</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Simple as in: Does not have all performance / load optimisations but is good enough for a user testing session
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Why high fidelity prototyping?</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Immersion</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Make use of familiarity</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Fulfill expectations</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Less guidance / more freedom</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Results more trustworthy / real</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Mention recently-played test where users where presented with static data.
							Expectation is key in those prototypes and when user's have an emotional connection
							to your product (e.g. they are collecting things on your platform) it is important to fulfill
							those emotional expectations.
						</p>
						<p>real data === not-polished data (long usernames, weird artowrk, color schemes) that you just don't design with</p>
						<p>
							Freedom as in users are free to do whatever and are not taken by their hands. You want them
							to express themselves freely.
						</p>

					<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">More expensive <span class="fragment current-visible">(‚è≤ + üí∞)</span></li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Works better for existing products</li>

						<p>A series of regular in-house usability tests</p>
						<p>We do it every three weeks to get regular unbiased feedback</p>
						<p>Everyone involved in the feature participates, designers, engineers, product managers. Creates empathy with the users. Imagine the difference between me telling you the results from a usability test or you actually being there in a session seeing a user struggle with something? Which one are you more likely to remember?</p>
						<p>Quick feedback: quickly test your designs</p>

					<h2>Diary studies</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>We give users a prototype to play around with for 2 weeks while checking in with us every other day</p>
						<p>We do this when we need more than quick feedback</p>

					<h2>Internal testing</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>We distribute prototypes company wide so everyone can stay up to date with what product design is up to</p>

					<h2>How we got into React Native</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>New Stream prototype</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Prototyping app written in Swift</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Prototyper busy with other prototypes</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">iOS devs busy with big launch</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">React Native was brand new (April '15)</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Curiosity and capacity from web devs</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>React Native 0.4.1 - right now we are at version 40</p>
						<p>Let's do it!</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="images/stream-old.jpg" style="max-width: 50%" />
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>old stream layout, see posts and reposts of people you follow</p>
						<p>not a lot of ways to interact with the content</p>
						<p>but therefore a clean interface</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="images/stream-prototype.jpg" style="max-width: 50%;" />
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>more points of interaction</p>
						<p>context of who posted this</p>
						<p>wanted to test: is it too much for the users? do they find it helpful?</p>
						<p>So it was important to provide it as an in-app replacement and needed to be tested in a real app where the user has the stream alongside their other data</p>

					<h2>2 weeks development time üéâ</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>without prior React knowledge</p>
						<p>including embedding it into the iOS prototyping app</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="http://i.giphy.com/Zcn7GKR8sh0Hu.gif">
					<h2>Users loved it üòç</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Users did not notice a difference between RN and the rest of the app</p>
						<p>Successful prototype all around: user feedback, new workflow, new technology</p>
						<p>Also: great feeling to observe users using your feautre for the first time</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Aftermath</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">The prototype dev left<span class="fragment fade-up">, with him all the knowledge</span></li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Complicated Swift/ObjC setup</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Hifi Prototyping stalled</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Fresh start with React Native</li>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>perfect example for the bus factor situation</p>
							<p>Great experience with React Native, so it was worth it for us to start fresh again</p>
						</aside>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Our current process how it is better now (svana)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Design team contributing, devs contributing</li>
						<li>Our prototypes before were solely made for iOS - now we have cross-platform capabilites</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Learnings / Take aways</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Learnings (svana &amp; jan)</h2>
					<li>Learning curve small compared to Java/Swift/Obj C(Native dev) (svana)</li>
					<li>Designers are able to contribute </li>
					<li>Bridge between dev/design - creates empathy for both sides!</li>
					<li>Speed</li>
					<li>Less sources of error</li>
					<li>Android (jan)</li>
					<li>As it is not static it surfaces a lot of questions / brings about a lot of improvements(-)</li>
					<li>Audio (con for us - but not for react native)</li>
					<li>ListView reordering(-)</li>
					<li>reflect about the fact that React Native is not the silver bullet to all prototyping-problems</li>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Cross platform</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">Two platforms but less developers</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">More people can be involved in the process</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>No audio support</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							that is obviously bad for us as we needed to spend more time on the audio part,
							but if your app does not need audio it is fine
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
					<p>React Native is not a silver bullet either</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>We're not saying you should only use hifi prototyping and only use React Native for that</p>
						<p>Each app / company has different requirements and you should evaluate the situation before deciding on a technology here</p>
						<p>We're just saying that it really worked well for us and we encourage you to give it a spin</p>
